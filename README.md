# GrubDash Front End Application

"I've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.
I set up a RESTful API, wrote custom validation functions, created route handlers, and built specific API endpoints. 
Of note, the front-end application was provided for this assignment."
## Installation

1. Fork / clone this repository.
1. Run `npm install`.

Use `npm start` to run the application.

Set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable to the base url for the API.

If `API_BASE_URL` is not set, a default value of `http://localhost:5000` is used.
